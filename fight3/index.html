      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This lightweight bout against an already ranked #13 Jalin Turner will be an absolute war and a test for both men. Bobby Green, a fighter bouncing from win to loss, has won his past two fights. The first win being against Tony Ferguson via submission and the second coming against Grant Dawson via a 33 second KO. Jalin Turner, the tallest lightweight in the division, standing at 6 '3, has lost his past two fights, both being a split decision. Both men are extremely talented strikers who have fight-ending striking ability. Bobby Green stands at 5 '10 inches tall with a 71 inch reach while Jalin Turner has a long 6' 3 stature and a 77 inch reach. Bobby Green will be at a strong reach disadvantage which gives Jalin Turner the upperhand in the striking department. On top of this Bobby Green is known for his “ hands down” and very boastful fighting style that has caused him to lose fights in the past. Bobby Green's style does place an unnecessary threat on him of being knocked out but it does make him more of a threat because it draws his opponent towards him more, giving him a better chance of throwing an unpredictable counter. With all factors considered, it would be wise to place your money on Jalin Turner, the -225 favorite.</p>
