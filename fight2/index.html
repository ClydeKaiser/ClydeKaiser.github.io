        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This fight without a doubt will be a masterful showcase of two fighters with extraordinary technique and ability in Mixed Martial Arts. Rakhmonov is a prospect in the UFC who has been a force to be reckoned with. He has finished every opponent he has faced and has a burning desire to secure the welterweight belt. His striking is a work of art and his Thai influenced kickboxing style makes him fast and powerful. To make him even more of a threat, he possesses a sensationally ground game and is a major submission threat. Stephen â€œ Wonderboy '' Thompson will without a doubt be the rising prospect's biggest test yet. His unorthodox Karate style makes him a very elusive, precise, and high pressure fighter. His extensive arsenal of kicks and hand strikes make him a threat at all times. His outclass of his last opponent Kevin Holland( also a rising prospect) showed fans how his experience and impeccable technique stands as a major problem for prospects looking to blow past him. Shavkat is a -465 favorite which means a bet with him would not payout too much of a return. Thompson stands as a +365 underdog which means a bet on him would have substantial payouts. Since our job is to ensure you make logical and intelligent bets, I would recommend placing a smaller bet on Thompson since payout would be high and the betting odds do not appreciate Thompsons veteran ability.</p>
