 <ol class="list"><strong class="mainly">It mainly comes down to a few things:</strong>
          </h3>
          <li>There are not enough freeways and not good enough alternatives</li>
          <li>Newer western cities like Los Angeles have less developed public transportation in comparision to states like New York, encouraging to use of cars, clogging roads</li>
          <li>Some freeways in Los Angeles don't have true intersections and cause clogs on freeway exits</li>
          <li>Due to the shear size of the city and car culture in Los Angeles, buying cars is promoted</li>

  <p class="solutions"> To alleviate traffic in Los Angeles, it is essential to invest in an efficient and extensive public transportation system. By expanding and improving the existing network of buses and trains, more residents can opt for public transit, reducing the number of private vehicles on the road. Additionally, implementing and promoting carpooling initiatives can further decrease the overall volume of traffic. Furthermore, investing in smart traffic management systems and infrastructure upgrades can enhance the flow of vehicles and reduce congestion. Collaborative efforts between government agencies, businesses, and the community are crucial to successfully address and mitigate traffic issues in Los Angeles. </p>
