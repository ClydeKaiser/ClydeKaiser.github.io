      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>On the entirety of the UFC 296 card, this fight is seen as the most controversial. Paddy Pimblett is a young prospect whose popularity skyrocketed early last year. With his last fight against Jared Gordon at UFC 282, fans and analysts alike are doubting Pimblett's ability to take on real competition. Tony Ferguson, a legend of MMA, hasn't had the glory of victory since June of 2019. He has 6 straight losses and fans are concerned that he may be suffering from cognitive damage from his extensive career in MMA. Despite this Tony Ferguson is a veteran of the sport and has nothing but difficult competition for the majority of his career in the UFC. With the betting odds making Ferguson a +240 underdog, a bet on him would not be a bad investment, and the payout would make it worthwhile.</p>
