    <h1>Learn How to Bet Smart</h1>
    <h2>Uunderstanding Odds</h2>
    <p>Sports betting odds typically will be in a decimal or positive/negative format. The decimal format is the most basic format in sports betting. A simple example would be if you were to win a $10 bet with 2.00 odds, your final payout would be $20. With positive or negative odds, a( +200)  shows the potential profit on a $100 bet, whereas a negative number (-150) shows how much you need to bet to make $100.</p>
    <h2>What are the Best Types of Bets to Make?</h2>
    <p>When betting on combat sports, you usually want to bet on something that doesn't require too much specifics, since fighting is one of the most unpredictable sports known to man. The safest bet you can make is a Moneyline bet. This bet simply is a prediction of who will win or lose. It doesn't get into the specifics of how the person will win, or how many strikes they throw. It's simply who wins the fight. A parlay bet is similar to this method but is adding a more volatile risk of losing money but creating a much higher payout at the same time. When making a parlay bet, you are betting on multiple winners of different fights. If you make five bets and four of your five bets win but one bet loses, you lose the entire bet. A four fight parlay usually payouts 10|1 odds which if you were to win a $100 parlay bet, you would get a return of $1,010.</p>
    
    <h2>Whats Important when Placing a Bet</h2>
    <p>If you were to browse the internet looking for advice on a specific bet, you are going to find all kinds of opinions and reasonings for why people believe one fighter will win over the other. Many people base their bets on the opinion of somebody they believe is a “ reputable” sports better, whether this be a youtuber, a family member, etc.. If you want to alleviate risk and make a bet with the best chances of winning you must do research on specific facts of the occurring fight. You have to do research on fighters' previous fights and certain tendencies they have and how those tendencies may be a detriment or an advantage against their upcoming opponent. If you have an idea of a fighter you want to bet on, its also important if not more important to research the opposition( a stage that most people overlook). Understanding the opposition will help you understand if a bet on your chosen fighter will be wise or not. Another great resource is taking into consideration DIFFERENT opinions of various fight analysts( NOT SPORTS BETTING INFLUENCERS). Fight analysts aren't looking to advise their viewers on which bet to make but rather breaking down the factual information that will play into effect during the fight. Hearing the different opinions of fight analysts( not just one) will be a crucial factor in helping you anticipate the fight. The information displayed on our website has been curated by a person who has done the research that has been advised above. We highly encourage you to do additional research on the advice that we give and use it as a foundation for your own opinion of the outcome of fights.</p>
    
    <h2>Risks to Keep in Mind</h2>
    <p>Sports betting isn't as bright and simple as it may seem. Especially in fighting, at any moment, something can happen that can change the course of the fight. The fighter you selected may be winning by all means but in just 1 simple mistake, you may find that fighter lying unconscious on the canvas. If you bet consistently you will lose bets because of a shocking upset. Fighters can also have a bad night and not perform to the best of their abilities, also handing you a losing bet. This is why it's important to have good bankroll management. Make a budget for your bets that are safe for you and don't exceed this amount. People who get into real trouble are the people who try to win back all their losses in one bet or try to make a huge payout with an extremely high bet. Don't bet more than you can afford to lose and if you see a pattern of losing its best to stop betting and give yourself some time to recuperate.</p>
    
    <h2>What to Look Out For</h2>
    <p>Different states have different regulations when it comes to sports betting. When facilitating your bets through betting apps, it's especially important to understand the jurisdictions in your state because the apps can suspend your account and freeze money inside of it. It's also extremely important to review the terms and conditions of the app because they may have specific rules on withdrawals and hidden fees. Some apps will have very specific rules for withdrawals of earnings that many users were completely unaware of. Another way to ensure that you're betting on an app that will properly compensate you is by looking at reviews. Many apps that are heavily promoted by celebrities and influencers actually have mass amounts of complaints and bad reviews. In the world of sports betting dont trust an app just because a celebrity is promoting them, the app is paying them for a reason! </p>
